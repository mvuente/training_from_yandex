There is a Building. The building has M floors. There are two flats with numbers K1 and K2.
K2 is in P2-th block on the N2-th floor (floor number starts at 1).
In which Block and wich floor is K1? Every floor has the same flats number.
M, K1, K2, N, P are between 1 and 1000000.(no negative, float or 0)
INPUT: K1 M K2 P2 N2
OUTPUT: P1 N1

If input data are wrong (K2 can not be at P2 or at N2) Oputput is -1 -1
If P1 or N1 couldn't be certainly determined, 0 should be inserted instead of respective variable.
For example:
INPUT 89 20 41 1 11
OUTPUT 2 3

INPUT 3 2 2 2 1
OUTPUT -1 -1

INPUT 11 1 1 1 1
OUTPUT 0 1
